title: About me
---

Programming to me was originally just an elective in high school. Once I realized the challenge and reward of creating complex software, I found my career. These days I'm usually working on something C++, Java, or Python related. I'm also a big proponent of Linux and Open Source Software.

When I'm not writing code I'm usually exploring the Pacific NorthWest, playing guitar, snowboarding, or eating ramen.
