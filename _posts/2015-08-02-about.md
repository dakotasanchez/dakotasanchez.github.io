title: About me
---

Programming to me started out as just an elective in high school. Once I realized the challenge and reward of creating software I found my career. These days I'm usually working on something Java, Python, or C++ related. I'm also a big proponent of Linux and Open Source Software.

When I'm not writing code I'm usually hiking, climbing, or eating.
