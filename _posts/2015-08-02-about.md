title: About me
---

I started programming in high school because I needed an extra class. The class ended up exceeding my expectations tenfold and I was hooked. These days I'm usually hacking away at something Android, Python, or Linux related. I'm a big supporter of Open Source and use GitHub obsessively.

When I'm not writing code I'm usually exploring Portland, practicing my guitar, snowboarding, or hiking somewhere in the beautiful Columbia Gorge.
