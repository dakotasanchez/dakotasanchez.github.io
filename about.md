I started programming in high school because I needed an extra class. The class ended up exceeding my expectations tenfold and I was hooked. These days I'm usually hacking away at something Android, Python, or Bash related. I'm a big supporter of Open Source and use GitHub extensively.    

When I'm not writing code I'm usually hanging out at a cafe, practicing my guitar, snowboarding, or hiking somewhere in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. The best trails I've found so far are in the Columbia Gorge.    

If you wish to contact me, check out my résumé on the home page.
